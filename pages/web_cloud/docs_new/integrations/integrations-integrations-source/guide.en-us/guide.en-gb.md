## Objective  

You might want to keep your code in a third-party repository that's linked to your Web PaaS project.
This means you keep all your workflows where you want and use Web PaaS for deploying.

Your Web PaaS project becomes a mirror of your code repository elsewhere.
This means you shouldn't push code directly to Web PaaS.
Any changes you push directly get overwritten by the integration when changes happen in the third-party repository.
