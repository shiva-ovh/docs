## Objective  

As the **official Web PaaS observability service**, 
[Blackfire](https://www.blackfire.io/) allows you to best optimize your code.
From development to testing, staging, and production,
Blackfire offers a unique blend of monitoring and profiling features. 
Blackfire works integrally with the Web PaaS workflow,
offering a smooth user experience.

Web PaaS also supports third-party services such as New Relic and Tideways.
Note that these third-party services have their own associated cost,
are language-specific, and may not be available for all languages.
