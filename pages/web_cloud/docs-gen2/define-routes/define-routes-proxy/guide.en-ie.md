Sometimes you want your app to pass requests on to a different Web PaaS project.
Basic redirects only work within the same project, so use proxy routes for routes elsewhere.​

You can define an external proxy on your Web PaaS project by defining a route like the following:

{{< version/specific >}}
<!-- Web PaaS configuration-->
```yaml {configFile="routes"}
https://{default}/foo:
    type: proxy
    to: https://www.example.com
```
