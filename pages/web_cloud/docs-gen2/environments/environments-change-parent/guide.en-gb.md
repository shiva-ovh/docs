## Objective  

All environments default to having another environment as their parent.
If you [branched](/glossary.md#branch) the environment from another,
its parent starts as the environment it was created from.
If you pushed a branch through Git or a [source integration](../environments/environments-integrations/source),
the parent defaults to the default environment.

To change the environment's parent, follow these steps:

> [!tabs]      

If you're not using a [source integration](../../integrations/integrations-source),
you can also set a parent for your environment when pushing changes to it.
To do so, run the following command:

```bash
git push -o "environment.parent={{< variable "PARENT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME" >}}"
```
