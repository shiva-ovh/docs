![Overview of projects in the Console](images/all-projects-revised.png "0.5")

This Console offers you ways to manage projects and environments other than the [command line interface (CLI))](../administration-cli).

## Project list


The [main Console page](https://console.platform.sh) gives you an overview of all your projects.
You can narrow the list down by searching for specific projects or choosing a specific organization from the menu.


Once you select a project, you can [configure the project settings](../.././.-configure-project).
You can also choose individual environments within the project and [configure each environment](../.././.-configure-environment).

You can also create a new project by clicking **+ Create project**.
