## Lock wait timeout

If a process running in your application acquired a lock from MySQL for a long period of time,
you receive MySQL error messages like this:

```sql
SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1205 Lock wait timeout exceeded;
```

This is typically caused by one of the following:

* There are multiple places acquiring locks in different order.
  For example, code path 1 first locks record A and then locks record B,
  while code path 2 first locks record B and then locks record A.
* There is a long running background process executed by your application that holds the lock until it ends.

If you're using [MariaDB 10+](../../.), use the SQL query `SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST \G` to list DB queries waiting for locks.
To determine where to debug, find output like the following:

```sql
< skipped >
Command: Query
Time: ...
State: Waiting for table metadata lock
Info: SELECT ...
< skipped >
```

To find active background processes, run `ps aufx` on your application container.

Make sure that locks are acquired in a pre-defined order and released as soon as possible.

## Definer/invoker of view lack rights to use them

There is a single MySQL user, so you can not use "DEFINER" Access Control mechanism for Stored Programs and Views.

When creating a `VIEW`, you may need to explicitly set the `SECURITY` parameter to `INVOKER`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE SQL SECURITY INVOKER
VIEW `view_name` AS
SELECT
```

## Server has gone away

### Disk space issues

Errors such as `PDO Exception 'MySQL server has gone away'` are usually the result of exhausting your available disk space.
Get an estimate of current disk usage using the CLI command `platform db:size`.
Just keep in mind it's an estimate and not exact.

{{< version/specific >}}
<!-- Version 1 -->

Allocate more space to the service in [`{{< vendor/configfile "services" >}}`](../).
As table space can grow rapidly,
it's usually advisable to make your database mount size twice the size reported by the `db:size` command.
