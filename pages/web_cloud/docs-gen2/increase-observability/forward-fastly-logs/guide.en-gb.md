## Objective  

When you use a Fastly Content delivery network (CDN),
[forwarding your CDN logs](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/about-fastlys-realtime-log-streaming-features) to a third-party service
can help you diagnose caching issues,
and therefore improve your site's overall performance.

To enable log forwarding on your Fastly CDN,
follow these directions:

- If you've subscribed to [Fastly through Web PaaS](../../domains/domains-cdn/managed-fastly),

  [contact Support](https://console.platform.sh/-/users/~/tickets/open).

- If you've subscribed to Fastly independently,

  see the official [Fastly documentation](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/logging/).
